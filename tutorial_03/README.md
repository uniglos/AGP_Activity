Continuing on with our tutorial series from where [tutorial 02](https://github.com/uniglos/CGP_Actvity/tree/master/tutorial_02) left off, this tutorial will introduce an implementation of getting the ball from Pong set up and moving around or canvas.

This tutorial will introduce: 
- using variables and operations upon those variables
- simple drawing of filled shapes 
- basic collision detection (we will keep the ball inside the bounds of the screen)

Follow along with the video tutorial below to get the ball rolling... (*I am so sorry for that pun*).
