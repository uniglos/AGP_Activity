Now that you have had a chance to familiarise yourself with VS Code we can move on with undertaking our first steps towards re-creating the classing game of Pong.

This is the first tutorial in this series where you will need to clone this repository from GitHub. 
Cloning this repository will pull down all the files and folders in this reposoitory to your computer. Including this file!

Once the repository has been cloned you will be able to work on it locally, however you will not be able to upload your changes to GitHub. In order to upload and push your code to GitHub you will need to fork this repository and not simply clone it. 
If you would like to know more about [Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or
[Forking a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) you can find out by following those links.
