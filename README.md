Welcome to this activity for the BSc Computer Games Programming course at the University of Gloucestershire! This session will give you the chance to get a taste of what kind of work you may be doing as a student on this course. Although instead of C++ or C# we're going to roll with Javascript as every kind of home computer can run this task and you can develop the code for this directly from within your web browser!

This GitHub Repository will take you through the steps you need to go through to create your own implementation of the classic game of Pong. This tutorial series is going to use Javascript and HTML5 to introduce you to the concepts of variables, functions, scope and classes. Each step of the tutorial has it's own folder to navigate through, with the tutorial lesson content presented in the markup readme.md file contained in each folder, the contents of this will be rendered in the browser on github for you to follow along with.

In order to get the most out of these tutorials you will need to set up a GitHub account and make use of Git. You can find all you need to know about setting up and getting up and running with GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github)

To get underway with this tutorial series head over to the GitHub page for [Tutorial 1](./tree/master/tutorial_01)

## Tutorial
Each subfolder on this activity has it's own read.me file that demonstrates the programming task that is required for each stage of the activity. There are video links to follow that will guide you through the creation of the game for this activity.

## Things to Try at home
Here are some helpful links that will give you some more knowledge on the subjects we cover on the Games Programming undergraduate course and as an extension to this activity.
